<p> 
  At <strong>IFIS</strong>, we aim to <strong>make machines reason and decide under profound uncertainty</strong>â€”not just to process data, but to understand the nature of <strong>belief, conflict, and ignorance</strong> embedded in the physical and abstract world. We explore the frontiers of <strong>information fusion</strong> and <strong>uncertainty quantification</strong>, blending classical <strong>Evidence Theory</strong> (Dempster-Shafer) with the mathematical elegance of <strong>Fuzzy Sets</strong>, <strong>Random Permutation Sets</strong>, and even <strong>Quantum Theory</strong>. 
</p>

<p> 
  Our philosophy is <strong>holistic</strong>: we believe that intelligent systems must be as deeply rooted in <strong>fundamental theories of uncertainty</strong> as they are in <strong>real-world utility</strong>. We let <strong>applications inform theory</strong>, and <strong>theoretical rigor guide applications</strong>. This dual lens is what makes our work both principled and impactful. We are driven by curiosity and a commitment to <strong>open, rigorous, and transformative science</strong>. 
</p>

<h4>Our research spans:</h4> 
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Uncertainty Theory &amp; Information Fusion</strong>: Developing novel frameworks (Dempster-Shafer Theory, D-Numbers, Random Permutation Sets) and entropy measures (Belief Entropy, Deng Entropy) to model and fuse conflicting, uncertain, and incomplete information.</li> 
  <li><strong>Quantum Information Processing</strong>: Exploring novel computational paradigms, including quantum circuits and quantum mass functions, to handle belief functions, model uncertainty, and accelerate information fusion.</li> 
  <li><strong>Fuzzy Systems</strong>: Developing fuzzy models for complex decision-making, pattern recognition, and control systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong>: Developing new models for complex forecasting and pattern recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex Network Analysis</strong>: Identifying influential nodes, assessing network vulnerability, and modeling information flow using evidential and entropy-based approaches.</li> 
  <li><strong>Intelligent Decision &amp; Risk Analysis</strong>: Applying our theoretical models to high-stakes applications, including multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), fault diagnosis, clustering (Evidential C-Means), and risk assessment (FMEA).</li> 
</ul>
